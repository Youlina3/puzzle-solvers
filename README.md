Unfortunately Z3 is not available for Ruby or even Python 3,
so I decided to do some exercises to learn how to use Z3 with Python 2.x.

In other words - use Python 2.x to run these.

To get z3 library, run this or equivalent:

    $ brew install z3

Unfortunately many solvers don't fully follow rules of puzzles they try to solve,
if rules were rather difficult to implement.
